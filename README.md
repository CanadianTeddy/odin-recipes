# odin-recipes

As the project goes, the homepage will have a main heading to inform the reader what they will expect and three links which lead to different html webpages for three different types of cookies.

In the end, I should be using different headings, boldings, creating links to another html webpage, includes images (of proper size), unordered lists for the ingredients, ordered lists for the recipes, and a final commit for all the webpages
