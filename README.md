# odin-recipes

This project will consist of a main homepage(index) which will include a few sections of different dishes with links to different HTML webpages that goes more in-depth of said recipes.

In the end, I should be using different headings, boldings, creating links to another html webpage, includes images (of different size), ordered lists for the recipes and finally commits every so often.
